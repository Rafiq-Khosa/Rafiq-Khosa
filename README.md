I hold a master's degree in Chemical Engineering from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, and a bachelor's degree from COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore Campus. My interests lie in tackling the dual challenges of renewable energy and environmental degradation through the development of advanced technologies.
